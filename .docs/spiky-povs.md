Parents buy bragging rights → focus on visible mastery of high-stakes scenarios.

Teens need status & rewards → leaderboards, streaks, XP, real-money-linked unlocks.

Narrow scope → 2-3 unforgettable, simulations or flows

Interactivity is the moat → text + pretty design won’t cut it.

Teach through real human behavior → gamify discipline, show pain/reward cycles.
